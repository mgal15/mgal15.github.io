                    <li>Add multiple levels of hints, each decrement total points given for each question</li>
                    <li>Add a server so students could add a group name or their name and it saves their total points and keeps a record of who played and when

                    <li>Add more spots and push it beyond just sculptures by thinking of fun/cool places on campus that students should check out - making it fun but also helpful to learn the area. </li>

                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    I want the purpose of this project to be for new students. This could be something posted about or on bulletin boards, and when a student sees it, they can play the game whenever. Its to help students get an idea for what is around campus.
