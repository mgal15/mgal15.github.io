            <h2>Spending 24 Hours Without The Internet</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Saturday the 26th, I spent 24 hours without using my phone/internet. I normally use my phone quite a bit so I knew I was going to have to set some rules for myself. I could not simply turn off my phone for the whole day due to having to stay in communicate with my family. The rules I set for myself were: 1. no social media 2. texting back family is okay 3. Can check work related notifications. But anything other than that I would ignore. I made sure to let my friends know I wouldn't be in communication, so to call if anything urgent happens. When I normally wake up in the morning, I'll spend some time scrolling on my social medias. So when I woke up I kept my phone charging and got ready without any distractions. I found that I was able to get ready a lot quicker and have some extra time to clean up my kitchen. Then I worked for the evening and hung out with family so I kept my phone in my purse and fought the urge to look at it while waiting, or sitting in the car. I was able to notice how many people use their phones during a lull. Thinking back to the readings I remembered when we chatted about how short attention spans are nowadays. I would reach for my phone open it up and go to a social media app, then realize what I was doing and turn it off. The times those events happened would be when I was waiting around and needed to fill my attention with something. I had a lot of self reflection and realized I should probably limit my screen time from now on. Overall I found this experience really awesome. I am someone who is "tied" to my phone so it was a little bit of a challenge to keep my phone tucked away while everyone around me was looking at it. However, I really enjoyed it. I found I had a lot more time in the morning, when normally I am rushing. I think this is something I will continue to be conscious about in the future. </p>
